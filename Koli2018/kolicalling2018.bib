This article investigates whether this is st ill the case today in England despite the changing higher education landscape si nce 2002. The article describes findings from a 2015 survey of prospective under graduates and compares them with those from the 2002 study. We find that student s¦ attitudes to taking on student loan debt are more favorable in 2015 than in 2 002. Debt-averse attitudes remain much stronger among lower-class students than among upper-class students, and more so than in 2002. However, lower-class stude nts in 2015 do not have stronger debt-averse attitudes than do middle-class stud ents. Finally, debt-averse attitudes seem more likely to deter planning for high er education among lower-class students in 2015 than in 2002.},
