% From CfP:
% Short papers (up to 5 pages) focus on dissemination and discussion of new ideas in computing education practice or research that merit wider awareness and discussion within the community. They can present preliminary results of new educational innovations, present and discuss novel educational technologies, report work-in-progress research (including promising systems or tools that have not yet been evaluated and/or adopted extensively), or raise issues of significance for the development of the discipline, such as long-term strategic needs for computing education and curricula. All short papers are expected to have an appropriate coverage of literature to support the ideas and arguments that they present. Because it lacks some elements of a research paper, a short paper is evaluated mainly by its anticipated impact on discussions during the conference and possible future contribution to the field of computing education.

\section{Introduction}
Superficially, the employment outlook for computing graduates in the UK looks excellent. \cite[p.~74]{UKCES2015b} states
\begin{quote}
the digital sub-sector will need 518,000 workers for roles in the three highest skilled occupational groups. However, over the last ten years only 164,000 individuals graduated from a first degree in computer science.
\end{quote}
\subsection{Employment}
Quoting this, the author of a UK Government-commissioned report \cite{Shadbolt2016a} writes
\begin{quote}
In this context, apparently high rates of unemployment\footnote{11.7\% six months after graduation (the standard UK measure) at the time of \cite{Shadbolt2016a}, compared with a STEM average of 8.4\%. Note, however, that Computing is 20\% of STEM \cite[Table 1]{Wakeham2016a}, so `STEM-less-Computing' has a 7.6\% unemployment rate.} amongst graduates of Computer Sciences and other STEM\footnote{STEM is ``Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics'' for \cite{Shadbolt2016a} and this paper.} courses demanded an explanation. 
\end{quote}
A significant explanation is ``There are notable differences in the characteristics of Computer Sciences entrants compared to entrants in other STEM subjects'' \cite[\P2.6]{Shadbolt2016a}: fewer women, but more mature students, Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) and students from backgrounds where people have traditionally not participated in HE (LPNs). Mature, BME and LPN students all find getting jobs more difficult.
\par
However, for those students that do find jobs, the data are better, showing \cite[Figure 6]{Shadbolt2016a} fewer students in ``non-graduate jobs'' or low-earning jobs than in STEM as a whole.
\subsection{Salary}
If we look beyond purely getting jobs to the salary\footnote{Clearly not the only measure of job quality, or contribution to society, but at least it's measurable, and has been measured in the LEO dataset \cite{DfE2017a}, which tracks individuals through school, university and into the labour market, combining educational, tax and benefits data.} the position (as described in \cite{DfE2018d}, and presented to the public in \cite{BBC2018f}, which also allows the reader to break down the data by university and subject.) is even less clear on a microscopic level, though on a macroscopic level it bears out much of what \cite{Shadbolt2016a} said.

On the macroscopic level, the reader should consider \cite[Table 5]{DfE2018d}. We focus on the `Men' data as presented here, as there are many more than there are women, though the effects are similar. This shows that an OLS (``Ordinary Least Squares'') fit shown that a man reading Computing would earn 3.3\% more than had he read a subject at random. If one corrects for prior attainment, this rises to 10.5\%, and 12.6\% if other factors are taken into account. For reasons explained in \cite[\S4.2]{DfE2018d}, the authors prefer IPRWA (``Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment''), and this moves the earning difference to 14.7\%. For men, the effect is to move Computing from being middle-of-the-pack \cite[Figure 15]{DfE2018d} to fourth best  \cite[Figure 17]{DfE2018d}, and for women is moves to seventh best  \cite[Figure 16]{DfE2018d}.
