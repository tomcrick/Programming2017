{\emph{Context:}} In the context of exploring the art, science
and engineering of programming, the question of which programming
languages should be taught first has been fiercely debated since
computer science teaching started in universities. Failure to grasp
programming readily almost certainly implies failure to progress in
computer science.\\
{\emph{Inquiry:}} What first programming languages
\emph{are} being taught? There have been regular national-scale
surveys in Australia and New Zealand, with the only US survey
reporting on a small subset of universities. This the first such
national survey of universities in the UK.\\
{\emph{Approach:}} We report the results of the first survey of introductory
programming courses ($\mathrm{N} = 80$) taught at UK universities as
part of their first year computer science (or related) degree
programmes, conducted in the first half of 2016.  We report on student
numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the underpinning rationale for
these choices.\\
{\emph{Knowledge:}} The results in this first UK
survey indicate a dominance of Java at a time when universities are
still generally teaching students who are new to programming (and
computer science), despite the fact that Python is perceived, by the
same respondents, to be both easier to teach as well as to learn.\\
{\emph{Grounding:}} We compare the results of this survey with a related
survey conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from 2001 and
2003) in Australia and New Zealand.\\
{\emph{Importance:}} This survey
provides a starting point for valuable pedagogic baseline data for the
analysis of the art, science and engineering of
programming, in the context of substantial computer science
curriculum reform in UK schools, as well as increasing scrutiny of
teaching excellence and graduate employability for UK universities.
